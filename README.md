# Skill Distillery - Week 8: MVC Film Site

This is a dynamic web application that allows the user to search a database for films using either the film ID or a keyword. Searching by the film ID will show the user the full film data associated with that ID. From there, the user can choose to edit or delete the film, or show all available copies in inventory sorted by store location. Searching by a keyword will locate all films with that sequence of characters in either the title or description fields. A list of films showing title, description, release year, language, and rental rate is displayed to the user and they are given the options to edit or delete the film, or view the full film details for any particular film on the list.

If the user chooses to edit the film, the user is directed to a film with editable fields populated with the film's current data. If the user chooses to delete the film, the user is directed to a confirmation page showing the film's details and prompting the user to confirm they want to delete the film shown.

The user can also choose to add new films and actors to the database, and associate actors to particular films.

At any time, the user may click the home icon to return to the main page.

# Lessons Learned

This is our first group project using a GitHub repository. Our team ran into merge conflicts a couple of times and we were able to quickly work through them to make sure everyone had the most current version.

###Jamie:
This project helped solidify my understanding of web forms, request mapping, MVC frameworks, data accessor objects and interfaces, and rendering results to a user using JSP expression language. Converting a standard java application into a dynamic web application was much more seamless than I had originally imagined, with many overlapping elements. Request mapping and passing hidden values to the controller streamlined the development process and made the application more user-friendly. The concept of PRG finally clicked when I could see it in action on our own program.

From a team perspective, it was a great experience to utilize GitHub for version control and pair programming to work through the tougher aspects of the code. Our team was diverse in that we all had different approaches to accomplish certain tasks, so I was able to learn new aspects of CSS/HTML and overall structure. All in all, a great experience for our first group project!

###Steph:
This project was great to see the real life aspects of working with a team on GitHub and in Spring. The way merge conflicts work was interesting to see. This project helped me to conceptualize the project as a whole and to gain the experience to feel more comfortable with the concept above like redirect and prepared statements. It also allowed for us to get plenty of hands on experience with HTML and CSS.
