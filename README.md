# Lessons Learned

This is our first group project. We learned how to use a GitHub repository together. Our team ran into merge conflicts a couple times and we were able to quickly work through them to make sure everyone had the most current version. We used Trello to make sure we were all on the same page about what needed to be done.

I learned a lot about the management of a SQL database. This project was great to see the real life aspects of working with a team on GitHub and in Spring MVC. The way merge conflicts work was interesting to see and my team and I had several. This project helped my to conceptualize a dynamic web page as a whole and to gain the experience to feel more comfortable with the concept above like redirect and prepared statements. It also allowed for us to get plenty of hands on experience with HTML and CSS.
